00:00:0,000 --> 00:00:9,640 
Hello, now we are going to learn to create new measures with the function X. 

2 
00:00:9,640 --> 00:00:20,480 
and avengex, max and maxx, Mean and Meanx. The difference between average and average is that average calculates 

3 
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,720 
The average of a specific column in the entire table, while avegex calculates the 

4 
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:36,360 
average of a personalized expression evaluated by row in a table and then takes the average 

5 
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:43,200 
of those results.A personalized expression is a formula written in Dax.A measure is 

6 
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:50,040 
A personalized expression.To understand the difference well, let's see an example. Let's create the 

7 
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:57,600 
New AGEGEGE AGEGE in the Olympic Events table.We click on New Measure and we put 

8 
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:10,160 
name to the measure that we said is Age average and this will be equal to average, here is, of the 

9 
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:16,840 
values that are in each row for the different Games, that is, for each of the games 

10 
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:31,240 
Olympic, so that means the values of Games, we close parentheses, coma and let's 

11 
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:39,880 
Calculate, calculate for each of those games the average of the age colon 

12 
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:50,200 
and we close parentheses and enter. 

13 
00:01:52,960 --> 00:02:1,240 
Here we have our Age Avenge measure.Avegex allows us to get the average of 

14 
00:02:1,240 --> 00:02:6,800 
the column but taking into account blocks of rows, in this case the Olympic Games, 

15 
00:02:6,840 --> 00:02:14,120 
That is, the different Olympics.In the visualization module we will open a page, 

16 
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:29,040 
We are going to call it X and we will create a matrix and place Games in Rows and the new measure in Values, 

17 
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,840 
Age average in Values. 

18 
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:42,920 
And so we can see the average age in each of the Olympics and the average age in 

19 
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:51,280 
All games that have been 25.8 years.Let's see the difference with average, we are going to 

20 
00:02:51,280 --> 00:03:0,960 
Transform Data, that is, in Power Query and we are going to select our Olimpic Events dataset 

21 
00:03:2,600 --> 00:03:8,840 
And we are going to click on the header of the AGE variable, we verify that the type of 

22 
00:03:8,840 --> 00:03:15,640 
Data is an integer, indeed has the Whole Number icon and we are going to locate the 

23 
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:25,200 
Number module column at the top.Being in transform and here is Number column and we are going 

24 
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:36,280 
to click on the statistical functions to locate average.Power Query shows us the 

25 
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:43,920 
Result, this is the average age of all athletes who have competed in all Olympics 

26 
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:50,800 
From history until 2016, but with average we cannot know the average age for each 

27 
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:57,840 
of the Olympic Games, as we see the value is different because this is an average of all 

28 
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:4,720 
The Age column numbers, with average X the average age of the age averages of 

29 
00:04:4,720 --> 00:04:11,240 
Each Olympiad.In the next class we will see the Rank X function, see you.
