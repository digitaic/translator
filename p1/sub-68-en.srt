00:00:0,000 --> 00:00:7,880 
Hello, now we are going to learn to create new measures with the X function.There are Sum and Sum 

2 
00:00:7,880 --> 00:00:17,440 
X, average and average x, Max and Max X, Mean and Mean X.The difference between average and 

3 
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:25,000 
None 

4 
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,080 
While Average X calculates the average of a personalized expression evaluated 

5 
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:38,900 
None 

6 
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:44,780 
Personalized is a formula written in Dax.A measure is a personalized expression. 

7 
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:51,020 
To understand the difference well, let's look at an example.Let's create the new measure 

8 
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:58,300 
Age average in the Olympic Events table.We click on New Measure and we name 

9 
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:8,900 
As we said that it is Age average and this will be equal to average x, here it is, 

10 
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,020 
None 

11 
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:23,820 
For each of the Olympic Games.So that means the values ​​of Games, 

12 
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:36,120 
We close parentheses, eat and let's calculate, calculate for each of 

13 
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,340 
Those games the average of the age colon. 

14 
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,220 
And we close parentheses and enter. 

15 
00:01:53,480 --> 00:02:1,160 
None 

16 
00:02:1,160 --> 00:02:6,000 
of the column but taking into account blocks of rows, in this case the 

17 
00:02:6,000 --> 00:02:12,080 
Olympic Games, that is, the different Olympics.In the visualization module, 

18 
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,540 
Let's open a page, let's call it x 

19 
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,880 
None 

20 
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:33,240 
And the new measure in Values, Age average in Values. 

21 
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:42,460 
And so we can see the average age in each of the Olympics and the average 

22 
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:49,800 
age in all games that has been 25.8 years.Let's see the difference with average, 

23 
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:59,300 
We are going to transform data, that is, in Power Query and we will select our 

24 
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:6,620 
Olympic Events dataset and we are going to click on the header of the AGE variable, 

25 
00:03:7,940 --> 00:03:12,000 
None 

26 
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,980 
Whole Number icon and we will locate the Number Column module at the top, 

27 
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:26,940 
being in transform and here is Number Column and we will click on the functions 

28 
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:36,980 
Statistics to locate average.Power Query shows us the result, 

29 
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:43,500 
This is the average age of all athletes who have competed in all 

30 
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:49,560 
Olympics of history until 2016, but with average we cannot know the average 

31 
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:55,980 
age for each of the Olympic Games, as we see the value is different because this 

32 
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:2,580 
It is an average of all the numbers of the AGE column, with average x it is calculated 

33 
00:04:2,580 --> 00:04:8,360 
The average age of each Olympiad age.In the next class we will see the 

34 
00:04:8,360 --> 00:04:11,380 
None
