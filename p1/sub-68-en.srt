00:00:0,000 --> 00:00:9,660 
Hello, now we will learn to create new measures with the X.Hay Sum and Sum X function, average 

2 
00:00:9,660 --> 00:00:19,280 
and average x, max and max x, Mean and Mean X.The difference between average and average x is that 

3 
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:25,800 
Average calculates the average of a specific column throughout the table, while 

4 
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:33,920 
Average X calculates the average of a personalized expression evaluated row per row in a 

5 
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,880 
table and then take the average of these results. A personalized expression is a written formula 

6 
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:49,440 
In Dax. A measure is a personalized expression. To understand the difference well, let's see an example. 

7 
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:57,120 
to create the new AGEGEGE measure in the Olympic Events table. Let's click on New Measure and 

8 
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:8,160 
We name him as we said that he is Age avege and this will be the same as average x.aquí 

9 
00:01:8,160 --> 00:01:16,320 
It is of the values ​​that are in each row for the different games, that is, for each of 

10 
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:30,640 
The Olympic Games. Then that means the values ​​of Games, we close parentheses, coma and 

11 
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:39,880 
We are going to calculate, calculate for each of those games the average of the age colon. 

12 
00:01:46,320 --> 00:02:0,400 
And we close parentheses and enter.aca we have our measure Age avege.Average x allows us to get the 

13 
00:02:0,400 --> 00:02:6,800 
average column but taking into account blocks of rows, in this case the Olympic Games, 

14 
00:02:6,800 --> 00:02:14,120 
That is, the different Olympics. In the visualization module we will open a page, 

15 
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:23,880 
We are going to call it X and we will create a matrix and we locate Games in Rows 

16 
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,840 
And the new measure in Values, Age average in Values. 

17 
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:42,920 
And so we can see the average age in each of the Olympics and the average age in 

18 
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:51,280 
all the games that have been 25.8 years. Let's see the difference with average, we will go to 

19 
00:02:51,280 --> 00:03:1,000 
Transform Data, that is, in Power Query and we are going to select our Olimpic Events dataset 

20 
00:03:2,600 --> 00:03:8,880 
And we are going to click on the header of the AGE variable, we verify that the type of 

21 
00:03:8,880 --> 00:03:15,640 
data is an integer number, effectively has the Whole Number icon and we will locate the 

22 
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:25,200 
Number module column at the top, being in transform and here is Number column and we are going 

23 
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:36,960 
to click on the statistical functions to locate average.power query shows us the result, 

24 
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:44,160 
This is the average age of all athletes who have competed in all the Olympics of the 

25 
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:51,040 
History until 2016, but with average we cannot know the average age for each of the 

26 
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:57,960 
Olympic games, as we see the value is different because this is an average 

27 
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:4,520 
AGE column numbers, with average X the average age of age averages is calculated 

28 
00:04:4,520 --> 00:04:11,240 
of each Olympiad.In the next class we will see the Rank X function, see you
