1 
00:00:0,000 --> 00:00:3,000 
Long live Sinuar himself told me more than once 

2 
00:00:3,000 --> 00:00:8,000 
whose wet dream is to enter Israel with the Nakoba units 

3 
00:00:8,000 --> 00:00:12,000 
of all kinds and swim Jews wherever they are 

4 
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000 
And after slaughtering all the Jews they will also reach Infidels 

5 
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000 
To all the infidels 

6 
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000 
Because the one who was in Shebak for 32 years 

7 
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000 
There is no difference between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority 

8 
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000 
These are prey and these are waste 

9 
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000 
Whoever does not pull out a diskette will do so immediately 

10 
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000 
We are not in the same situation as the Friday of October 

11 
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000 
Today we are in danger, even existential danger 

12 
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:1,000 
Who was waiting for me? 

13 
00:01:1,000 --> 00:01:3,000 
Over 30 years in Shebak 

14 
00:01:3,000 --> 00:01:5,000 
The person in charge of investigations in Shebak 

15 
00:01:5,000 --> 00:01:7,000 
And those who got to investigate personally 

16 
00:01:7,000 --> 00:01:9,000 
You are Yahya Sinwar 

17 
00:01:9,000 --> 00:01:11,000 
And more are allowed no less than him 

18 
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000 
After your experience tonight 

19 
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000 
should i have asked you 

20 
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000 
What would you like the public to know about these organizations and people in one sentence? 

21 
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000 
what do you think? 

22 
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000 
We don't know about them and it's right that we know about them 

23 
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000 
You see, this is a very cruel Nazi organization 

24 
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000 
this organization 

25 
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000 
actually want to 

26 
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000 
And always wanted to 

27 
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000 
kill jews 

28 
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000 
Jews swim 

29 
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000 
Long live Sinuar himself told me more than once 

30 
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000 
How personally? 

31 
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000 
I am personally under investigation 

32 
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000 
Number of times 

33 
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000 
that his wet dream 

34 
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000 
It is to enter Israel 

35 
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000 
with the piercing units 

36 
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000 
of sorts and to swim Jews 

37 
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000 
As they 

38 
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000 
After they corrupted all the Jews 

39 
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000 
They will also come to Infadels 

40 
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:1,000 
To all the infidels 

41 
00:02:1,000 --> 00:02:3,000 
in 1989 

42 
00:02:3,000 --> 00:02:5,000 
I'm waiting for me 

43 
00:02:5,000 --> 00:02:7,000 
I arrested all of Hamas 

44 
00:02:7,000 --> 00:02:9,000 
The entire military faction of Hamas 

45 
00:02:9,000 --> 00:02:11,000 
520 people 

46 
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000 
I stopped 

47 
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000 
Among them are only Madiasi, Selah, Shacha, Denizhara and Rodel, Larnetsi 

48 
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000 
Mahmoud, Zohar 

49 
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000 
Everyone you just think 

50 
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000 
I stopped 

51 
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000 
And of course, long live the sinewer 

52 
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000 
And when I met with Rabin 

53 
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000 
in a personal meeting after 

54 
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000 
The investigation when he was interested 

55 
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000 
I told him Mr. Prime Minister 

56 
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000 
This organization is a Nazi organization 

57 
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000 
Extremely dangerous for the State of Israel 

58 
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000 
We must destroy him 

59 
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000 
When he is small, woe to us 

60 
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000 
If we release these restraints 

61 
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000 
It was in 89 

62 
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000 
since 

63 
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000 
A number were made 

64 
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000 
Exchange transactions 

65 
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000 
When the first between them was a deal 

66 
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000 
Jibril in 1985 

67 
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000 
release 

68 
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000 
1500 terrorists 

69 
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000 
We ate it big 

70 
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:1,000 
When Rabin removed 400 people 

71 
00:03:1,000 --> 00:03:3,000 
to Lebanon from Hamas 

72 
00:03:3,000 --> 00:03:5,000 
And very much the organizations of the attorney's office 

73 
00:03:5,000 --> 00:03:7,000 
She refused to defend his position 

74 
00:03:7,000 --> 00:03:9,000 
Then he was forced some time later 

75 
00:03:9,000 --> 00:03:11,000 
Return them all to Israel 

76 
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000 
When they had already been there for a while 

77 
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000 
We trained and soaked there 

78 
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000 
All kinds of other opinions 

79 
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000 
Rabin was humiliated in the meeting 

80 
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000 
It was great by the prosecution 

81 
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000 
and yet 

82 
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000 
Dori Bini she added 

83 
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000 
to represent him in Bagetz 

84 
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000 
And still your acquaintance 

85 
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000 
With the late Prime Minister Yzerek Rabin 

86 
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000 
and his acquaintance with Hamas 

87 
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000 
They led him further 

88 
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000 
No less dubious transactions 

89 
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000 
Look there were a number of shady deals 

90 
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000 
Like I said first 

91 
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000 
There was Jibril 

92 
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000 
Then there was Sharon's deal 

93 
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000 
with a thousand and some 

94 
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000 
The three bodies 

95 
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000 
And before that it should be said 

96 
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000 
All of Oslo just a week ago 

97 
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000 
Palestinian policeman 

98 
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000 
shoots with a weapon 

99 
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000 
provided by the army 

100 
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:1,000 
Come on, I just want to tell you 

101 
00:04:1,000 --> 00:04:3,000 
I am like someone who spent 32 years in Shevak 

102 
00:04:3,000 --> 00:04:5,000 
There is no difference between Hamas 

103 
00:04:5,000 --> 00:04:7,000 
and the Palestinian Authority 

104 
00:04:7,000 --> 00:04:9,000 
These are prey and these are waste 

105 
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000 
I was in a trap 

106 
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000 
in a senior position 

107 
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000 
I was afraid to express my opinion 

108 
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000 
Even in front of those degrees freedoms 

109 
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000 
Shebak chiefs and others 

110 
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000 
without mentioning names 

111 
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000 
A lot of mistakes 

112 
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000 
people went 

113 
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000 
After politics 

114 
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000 
people went to 

115 
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000 
to help one or another prime minister 

116 
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000 
Only politically 

117 
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000 
promote themselves 

118 
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000 
Shebak people 

119 
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000 
I said I wouldn't mention names to them 

120 
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000 
They are very simple 

121 
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000 
to please 

122 
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000 
Prime ministers 

123 
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000 
from a certain area 

124 
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000 
They just followed them 

125 
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000 
and took steps that made us 

126 
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000 
for blunders 

127 
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000 
sometimes 

128 
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000 
I will give you an example 

129 
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:1,000 
When I first wanted to stop her 

130 
00:05:1,000 --> 00:05:3,000 
You are Ahmed Yassin 

131 
00:05:3,000 --> 00:05:5,000 
Someone told me 

132 
00:05:5,000 --> 00:05:7,000 
I'm not going to make a mess for the Rebbe 

133 
00:05:7,000 --> 00:05:9,000 
If I have to simplify the things you say 

134 
00:05:9,000 --> 00:05:11,000 
which is inside the hole 

135 
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000 
and rested 

136 
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000 
There are political considerations 

137 
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000 
Unfortunately yes 

138 
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000 
Look we have 

139 
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000 
sex 

140 
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000 
method 

141 
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000 
every one 

142 
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000 
In many places, not only in the police 

143 
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000 
Both in joy and in heaven 

144 
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000 
Wherever you want to move 

145 
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000 
the period of silence 

146 
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000 
Everyone wants to pass a term 

147 
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000 
his shift 

148 
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000 
which is a lousy feature 

149 
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000 
In my opinion 

150 
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000 
The concept has not changed 

151 
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000 
Also military personnel and politicians 

152 
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000 
When you hear a certain sentence 

153 
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000 
I hear Alosh in joy 

154 
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000 
who says 

155 
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000 
to be released 

156 
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000 
Kidnapped at any cost 

157 
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000 
Including withdrawal to the borders of October 6 

158 
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000 
And the concept remained 

159 
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:1,000 
He didn't sleep on the diskette 

160 
00:06:5,000 --> 00:06:7,000 
I don't have any savings 

161 
00:06:7,000 --> 00:06:9,000 
About the disappointments that were for October 

162 
00:06:9,000 --> 00:06:11,000 
And there were huge elephants 

163 
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000 
There was an unprecedented failure 

164 
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000 
Of course I'm angry 

165 
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000 
And I'm angry at all those people 

166 
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000 
These cellulosic swamps 

167 
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000 
Even though they currently do 

168 
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000 
Good job and they keep going 

169 
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000 
and fight 

170 
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000 
They are brilliant people 

171 
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000 
And some of them I also know personally 

172 
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000 
They are really brilliant people 

173 
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000 
But the doubts they made 

174 
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000 
They will not steal 

175 
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000 
Guaranteed forever 

176 
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000 
We must all unite 

177 
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000 
in the fight against 

178 
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000 
The enemy reclaims the nation 

179 
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000 
And if we don't do it 

180 
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000 
He will get back on his feet 

181 
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000 
He will rebuild himself 

182 
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000 
And we will see more 

183 
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000 
such a range 

184 
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000 
in other places 

185 
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000 
We must take the authority into account 

186 
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000 
with all the sayings 

187 
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:1,000 
said by the heads of the Authority immediately after 

188 
00:07:1,000 --> 00:07:3,000 
this war 

189 
00:07:3,000 --> 00:07:5,000 
On the radio, on television 

190 
00:07:5,000 --> 00:07:7,000 
Anywhere to be touched 

191 
00:07:7,000 --> 00:07:9,000 
in additional settlements and to cook 

192 
00:07:9,000 --> 00:07:11,000 
And you have to reckon with them 

193 
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000 
Don't panic about it, this panic 

194 
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000 
She is the weakness you talk too much about 

195 
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000 
We must reckon with them 

196 
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000 
We can not 

197 
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000 
Leave this issue of 

198 
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000 
Payments to martyrs 

199 
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000 
to the families who testify 

200 
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000 
This topic must be deleted from the world 

201 
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000 
What is important to me is that there should be unity 

202 
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000 
There will be a fight 

203 
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000 
You are there for anyone who wants it 

204 
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000 
to touch us 

205 
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000 
If it is in Judea and Moron, if it is in Lebanon 

206 
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000 
Certainly also in Gaza 

207 
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000 
We must have these things 

208 
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000 
We all remember 

209 
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000 
Whoever does not pull out a diskette will do so immediately 

210 
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000 
We are not in the same situation 

211 
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000 
of the sixth of October 

212 
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000 
We are in danger today 

213 
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000 
that even existential danger 

214 
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000 
And if we don't do it, it will come upon us 

215 
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000 
like a boomerang 

216 
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000 
There is no doubt that the subject of the abductees 

217 
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:1,000 
This is the most painful issue 

218 
00:08:1,000 --> 00:08:3,000 
that we have today in the defense of Israel 

219 
00:08:3,000 --> 00:08:5,000 
This should be an important task 

220 
00:08:5,000 --> 00:08:7,000 
Bring them all back 

221 
00:08:7,000 --> 00:08:9,000 
But I am one of those who claim 

222 
00:08:9,000 --> 00:08:11,000 
Not at any cost 

223 
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000 
if it depends on it 

224 
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000 
We are also a country 

225 
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000 
we can not 

226 
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000 
to damage our image as a country 

227 
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000 
We will have to 

228 
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000 
release them 

229 
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000 
by other means 

230 
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000 
No way 

231 
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000 
not at the expense of 

232 
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000 
The settlements of Ha'ofet 

233 
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000 
And not at the expense of him entering 

234 
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000 
Amla followed him into a strip 

235 
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000 
We will not be given to Hamas 

236 
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000 
to exist forever 

237 
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000 
Must conquer and destroy 

238 
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000 
all his abilities 

239 
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000 
and make sure they are no more 

240 
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000 
In power, never
