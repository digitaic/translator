1 
00:00:0,000 --> 00:00:12,500 
Yichi Sinuar himself has told me many times that the dream of his life is to enter Israel with the Nokba units and kill Jews wherever they are. 

2 
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:17,500 
And after they have corrupted all the Jews, they will also reach Impedles to all the infidels. 

3 
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:26,500 
As someone who spent 32 years in Shevka, there is no difference between the Hametz and the Volselin authority, those are prey and those are waste. 

4 
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:33,000 
If I don't include a diskette that will do it immediately, we are not in the same situation as the sixth of October. 

5 
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000 
Today we are in danger, which is not an existential danger. 

6 
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:14,000 
Who was waiting for me? More than 30 years in Shevak, who is in charge of investigations in Shevuk and who had the opportunity to personally investigate the likes of Sinuar and other villains no less than him. 

7 
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,500 
After your extensive experience, if I had to ask you, what would you like the public to know about organizations and these people in one sentence? 

8 
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,000 
what do you think? We do not know about them and it is right that we know about them. 

9 
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000 
This is a very cruel Nazi organization. 

10 
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000 
This organization actually wants and has always wanted to kill Jews, kill Jews. 

11 
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000 
As Yesinuar himself told me more than once? 

12 
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000 
did you feel 

13 
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:54,500 
I have personally been questioned several times that his wet dream is to enter Israel with the Nokba units and kill Jews wherever they are. 

14 
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:59,500 
And after they have corrupted all the Jews, they will also reach Impedles to all the infidels. 

15 
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:5,000 
In 1989, I was waiting for me, I created all of Hamas. 

16 
00:02:5,000 --> 00:02:9,000 
The entire military faction of Hamas, 520 people, I narrowed down. 

17 
00:02:9,000 --> 00:02:17,000 
Among them, Ahmed Yassi, at Achsha, Deniza Rabodel, Larnetisi, Mahmoud, Zohar, everyone you can think of, I'm worried. 

18 
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000 
And of course also Yahs, Inuar, Berv Himushta, Marvin Naisa, all of them were the Tsurim. 

19 
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000 
And when I met with Rabin, in a personal meeting, after the investigation, when he was interested, I told him Mr. Prime Minister. 

20 
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000 
This organization, the Nazi organization, is extremely dangerous against Israel, we must destroy it when it is small, 

21 
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000 
Oh, we have to release restraints on the helo. 

22 
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000 
It was in 1989. 

23 
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000 
Since then I have made a number of replacement entitlements, 

24 
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,000 
When the first among them was Jibril, in 1985 1500 terrorists were killed. 

25 
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000 
We ate it big. 

26 
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:3,000 
When Rabin deported 400 people to Lebanon, 100 to Hamas, with a lot of casualties, 

27 
00:03:3,000 --> 00:03:7,000 
The prosecution objected to defend his position. 

28 
00:03:7,000 --> 00:03:10,000 
And then he had to return them all after a while, 

29 
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000 
to Israel, when there was already a period of its name, they trained and absorbed its name, 

30 
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000 
All kinds of opinions after. 

31 
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000 
Rabin was humiliated, Rabin was greatly humiliated by the prosecution. 

32 
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000 
and yet... 

33 
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000 
You don't see Bin Shatirva representing him in a garment. 

34 
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000 
Still. 

35 
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000 
And yet, the acquaintance of the late Haim Berashim Tzerk Rabin, 

36 
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000 
and the familiarity that is not with Hamas, 

37 
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000 
They later led him to no less dubious concessions. 

38 
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000 
Look, there were a number of shady deals, 

39 
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000 
As I said the first was Gabriel, 

40 
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000 
Then there was Sharon's win with a thousand and one, 

41 
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000 
And for the three bodies in Tenenbarb. 

42 
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000 
And before I have to say, 

43 
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000 
All of Oslo, just a week ago, 

44 
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000 
A Palestinian policeman shoots with a weapon provided by the IDF. 

45 
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:0,000 
Come on, I just want to tell you, I, 

46 
00:04:0,000 --> 00:04:2,000 
As someone who spent 32 years in Shevc, 

47 
00:04:2,000 --> 00:04:6,000 
There is no difference between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority. 

48 
00:04:6,000 --> 00:04:8,000 
Those, Trepa and those for Bella. 

49 
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000 
I was at Shev K in a senior position, 

50 
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000 
But I was never afraid to speak my mind, 

51 
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000 
Even in front of them, degrees of freedom, 

52 
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000 
Other network heads, without remembering names, 

53 
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000 
A lot of mistakes were made. 

54 
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000 
People followed politics. 

55 
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000 
People went to help one prime minister or another, 

56 
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000 
only politically, 

57 
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000 
Only you, in my opinion, people are Shebek people. 

58 
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000 
Shebak people. 

59 
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000 
Not politicians. 

60 
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000 
I said I didn't mention that it was donated, 

61 
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000 
They are very simple to please prime ministers 

62 
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000 
from a certain area, 

63 
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000 
They just followed them. 

64 
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000 
And so many steps that caused us to make terrible mistakes sometimes. 

65 
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000 
I'll give you an example. 

66 
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:1,000 
Because when I first wanted to do but from design, 

67 
00:05:1,000 --> 00:05:3,000 
Someone told me, 

68 
00:05:3,000 --> 00:05:6,000 
I'm not going to make a mess of Rabin. 

69 
00:05:6,000 --> 00:05:8,000 
If I have to simplify the things you say, 

70 
00:05:8,000 --> 00:05:12,000 
You say that inside the Shev as Warsaw, 

71 
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000 
There are political considerations. 

72 
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000 
Unfortunately yes. 

73 
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000 
Look, we have 

74 
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000 
kind of method, 

75 
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000 
that each 

76 
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000 
in places, not only in the police, 

77 
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000 
Even in the crowd, also in the sky everywhere, 

78 
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000 
who want to pass the period of silence. 

79 
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000 
Everyone wants to move forward. 

80 
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000 
You are his shift. 

81 
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000 
You keep his watch quietly. 

82 
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000 
Which is a terrible trait for daddies. 

83 
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000 
These concepts have changed, 

84 
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000 
Both military personnel and politicians. 

85 
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000 
For example, you see, 

86 
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000 
When you hear a certain sentence, 

87 
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000 
that I hear rose in joy, 

88 
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000 
which says that it must be released 

89 
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000 
kidnapped at any cost, 

90 
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000 
including reaching the 60 October limits, 

91 
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000 
This is the dropout concept. 

92 
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:1,000 
He didn't change the diskette. 

93 
00:06:5,000 --> 00:06:7,000 
I don't have any battery on the cell phones 

94 
00:06:7,000 --> 00:06:9,000 
were for October, 

95 
00:06:9,000 --> 00:06:11,000 
And there were huge cells. 

96 
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000 
There was an unprecedented failure. 

97 
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000 
Of course I'm angry. 

98 
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000 
And I'm angry at all those people 

99 
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000 
They vacated these cells. 

100 
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000 
Even though they are currently doing a good job, 

101 
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000 
and they continue, 

102 
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000 
and they fight, 

103 
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000 
And they are Hebrew people. 

104 
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000 
And some of them I also know personally. 

105 
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000 
They are really Hebrew people. 

106 
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000 
But the doubts they made 

107 
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000 
will not be forgiven, 

108 
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000 
She must never be forgiven. 

109 
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000 
We must all unite 

110 
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000 
in the fight against 

111 
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000 
Or this foreigner of the nation. 

112 
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000 
And if we don't do it, 

113 
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000 
He will stand up again, 

114 
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000 
He will rebuild himself, 

115 
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000 
And we will see another such range, 

116 
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000 
in other places. 

117 
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000 
the authority, 

118 
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000 
We have to reckon 

119 
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000 
with all the sayings, 

120 
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:1,000 
said by the heads of the Authority 

121 
00:07:1,000 --> 00:07:3,000 
Right after this war. 

122 
00:07:3,000 --> 00:07:5,000 
They said hail, Yuba TV everywhere, 

123 
00:07:5,000 --> 00:07:7,000 
to be reached in additional settlements, 

124 
00:07:7,000 --> 00:07:9,000 
and cook 

125 
00:07:9,000 --> 00:07:11,000 
It is necessary to make an account with them. 

126 
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000 
Don't dwell on it. 

127 
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000 
do not hesitate, 

128 
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000 
We must reckon with them. 

129 
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000 
We must not leave this issue 

130 
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000 
of payments to witnesses, 

131 
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000 
To the families who are witnesses. 

132 
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000 
This topic must be deleted from the world. 

133 
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000 
what is mine important, 

134 
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000 
let there be unity, 

135 
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000 
let there be a fight, 

136 
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000 
She bows to anyone who wants to 

137 
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000 
to touch us, 

138 
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000 
If it is in Judah and Shimron, 

139 
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000 
Baba and Adi also Buzzer. 

140 
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000 
We all owe these things 

141 
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000 
Remember, whoever I don't curse 

142 
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000 
diskette that will do this immediately, 

143 
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000 
We are not in the same situation 

144 
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000 
of the sixth of October. 

145 
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000 
We are in danger today. 

146 
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000 
that even existential danger. 

147 
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000 
And if we don't do it, 

148 
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000 
It will come upon us as Boomer-ang. 

149 
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:1,000 
what a request 

150 
00:08:1,000 --> 00:08:3,000 
the theme of the hijabs, 

151 
00:08:3,000 --> 00:08:5,000 
And the most painful subject we have 

152 
00:08:5,000 --> 00:08:7,000 
in the defense of Israel. 

153 
00:08:7,000 --> 00:08:9,000 
This should be an important goal 

154 
00:08:9,000 --> 00:08:11,000 
Bring them all back. but, 

155 
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000 
I'm one of those who say no at all costs. 

156 
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000 
if it depends, 

157 
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000 
This is who we are as a country, 

158 
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000 
We can't compromise the image 

159 
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000 
ours as a country. 

160 
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000 
We will have to 

161 
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000 
release them by other means. 

162 
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000 
no way, 

163 
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000 
And of course not at your expense 

164 
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000 
the surrounding settlements, 

165 
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000 
and not at the expense of 

166 
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000 
Then Amdala punched into the strip. 

167 
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000 
We will not be given to Hamas 

168 
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000 
to exist forever. 

169 
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
