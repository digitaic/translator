1 
00:00:0,000 --> 00:00:13,480 
And we discovered that the data form is different, that is, the behavior of the data is different. 

2 
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,640 
The relationships between the number of boxes and time are different. We see that although 

3 
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:25,920 
we have the same regression line, we have four different data behaviors. 

4 
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,880 
What we just saw is a very powerful concept in statistics called the Anscom quartet, which 

5 
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,680 
shows us the importance of seeing the shape of the data, the relationships between the variables, 

6 
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:42,240 
and it is important in data storytelling because the shape of the data helps us find the context 

7 
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,600 
of the story that we are going to tell. After seeing the shape of the data and finding 

8 
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:52,360 
relationships, the storyteller will identify with one of those relationships and will decide 

9 
00:00:52,360 --> 00:01:0,600 
to tell the story from that angle, giving prominence to certain variables. 

10 
00:01:0,600 --> 00:01:5,280 
And when we find that angle, from where we will tell the story, we will also discover 

11 
00:01:5,280 --> 00:01:10,160 
the feeling that it generates and that we are going to generate in the audience. We want that 

12 
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:15,920 
During the story that we are going to tell, the audience feels happy, surprised, afraid, 

13 
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:22,080 
with rage, embarrassed or empowered, with desire to conquer the world. First we must discover 

14 
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:31,600 
how we feel to replicate that feeling. First we must discover how we feel to replicate 

15 
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,360 
the feeling.
