Hello, now we are going to learn to create new measures with the X function.There are Sum and Sum 

X, average and average x, Max and Max X, Mean and Mean X.The difference between average and 

Average x is that average calculates the average of a specific column throughout the table, 

While Average X calculates the average of a personalized expression evaluated 

row per row in a table and then take the average of those results.An expression 

Personalized is a formula written in Dax.A measure is a personalized expression. 

To understand the difference well, let's look at an example.Let's create the new measure 

Age average in the Olympic Events table.We click on New Measure and we name 

As we said that it is Age average and this will be equal to average x, here it is, 

of the values ​​that are in each row for the different games, that is, 

For each of the Olympic Games.So that means the values ​​of Games, 

We close parentheses, eat and let's calculate, calculate for each of 

Those games the average of the age colon. 

And we close parentheses and enter. 

Here we have our Age Avenge measure.Average x allows us to get the average 

of the column but taking into account blocks of rows, in this case the 

Olympic Games, that is, the different Olympics.In the visualization module, 

Let's open a page, let's call it x 

And we are going to create a matrix and place Games in Rows 

And the new measure in Values, Age average in Values. 

And so we can see the average age in each of the Olympics and the average 

age in all games that has been 25.8 years.Let's see the difference with average, 

We are going to transform data, that is, in Power Query and we will select our 

Olympic Events dataset and we are going to click on the header of the AGE variable, 

We verify that the data type is an integer, effectively has the 

Whole Number icon and we will locate the Number Column module at the top, 

being in transform and here is Number Column and we will click on the functions 

Statistics to locate average.Power Query shows us the result, 

This is the average age of all athletes who have competed in all 

Olympics of history until 2016, but with average we cannot know the average 

age for each of the Olympic Games, as we see the value is different because this 

It is an average of all the numbers of the AGE column, with average x it is calculated 

The average age of each Olympiad age.In the next class we will see the 

Rank X function, see you.
