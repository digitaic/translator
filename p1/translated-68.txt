Hello, now we are going to learn to create new measures with the function X. 

and avengex, max and maxx, Mean and Meanx. The difference between average and average is that average calculates 

The average of a specific column in the entire table, while avegex calculates the 

average of a personalized expression evaluated by row in a table and then takes the average 

of those results.A personalized expression is a formula written in Dax.A measure is 

A personalized expression.To understand the difference well, let's see an example. Let's create the 

New AGEGEGE AGEGE in the Olympic Events table.We click on New Measure and we put 

name to the measure that we said is Age average and this will be equal to average, here is, of the 

values that are in each row for the different Games, that is, for each of the games 

Olympic, so that means the values of Games, we close parentheses, coma and let's 

Calculate, calculate for each of those games the average of the age colon 

and we close parentheses and enter. 

Here we have our Age Avenge measure.Avegex allows us to get the average of 

the column but taking into account blocks of rows, in this case the Olympic Games, 

That is, the different Olympics.In the visualization module we will open a page, 

We are going to call it X and we will create a matrix and place Games in Rows and the new measure in Values, 

Age average in Values. 

And so we can see the average age in each of the Olympics and the average age in 

All games that have been 25.8 years.Let's see the difference with average, we are going to 

Transform Data, that is, in Power Query and we are going to select our Olimpic Events dataset 

And we are going to click on the header of the AGE variable, we verify that the type of 

Data is an integer, indeed has the Whole Number icon and we are going to locate the 

Number module column at the top.Being in transform and here is Number column and we are going 

to click on the statistical functions to locate average.Power Query shows us the 

Result, this is the average age of all athletes who have competed in all Olympics 

From history until 2016, but with average we cannot know the average age for each 

of the Olympic Games, as we see the value is different because this is an average of all 

The Age column numbers, with average X the average age of the age averages of 

Each Olympiad.In the next class we will see the Rank X function, see you.
