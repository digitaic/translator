Hello, now we will learn to create new measures with the X.Hay Sum and Sum X function, average 

and average x, max and max x, Mean and Mean X.The difference between average and average x is that 

Average calculates the average of a specific column throughout the table, while 

Average X calculates the average of a personalized expression evaluated row per row in a 

table and then take the average of these results. A personalized expression is a written formula 

In Dax. A measure is a personalized expression. To understand the difference well, let's see an example. 

to create the new AGEGEGE measure in the Olympic Events table. Let's click on New Measure and 

We name him as we said that he is Age avege and this will be the same as average x.aquí 

It is of the values that are in each row for the different games, that is, for each of 

The Olympic Games. Then that means the values of Games, we close parentheses, coma and 

We are going to calculate, calculate for each of those games the average of the age colon. 

And we close parentheses and enter.aca we have our measure Age avege.Average x allows us to get the 

average column but taking into account blocks of rows, in this case the Olympic Games, 

That is, the different Olympics. In the visualization module we will open a page, 

We are going to call it X and we will create a matrix and we locate Games in Rows 

And the new measure in Values, Age average in Values. 

And so we can see the average age in each of the Olympics and the average age in 

all the games that have been 25.8 years. Let's see the difference with average, we will go to 

Transform Data, that is, in Power Query and we are going to select our Olimpic Events dataset 

And we are going to click on the header of the AGE variable, we verify that the type of 

data is an integer number, effectively has the Whole Number icon and we will locate the 

Number module column at the top, being in transform and here is Number column and we are going 

to click on the statistical functions to locate average.power query shows us the result, 

This is the average age of all athletes who have competed in all the Olympics of the 

History until 2016, but with average we cannot know the average age for each of the 

Olympic games, as we see the value is different because this is an average 

AGE column numbers, with average X the average age of age averages is calculated 

of each Olympiad.In the next class we will see the Rank X function, see you
